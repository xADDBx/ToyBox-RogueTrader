Reworked Localization:
- Old System was very bad (changing a typo in english would break that string for other languages; etc.)
- New System has better performance; it also needs basically no maintainance outside of actually translation.

Reworked Patching:
- Patches are now very granular, which means that
  1. With just ToyBox installed and no feature enabled, the game would be nearly vanilla (i.e. nearly no changes)
  2. Improved general performance. Impact might be minor; but it does exist
  3. Improved compatbility with game updates: One feature breaking wouldn't break the whole mod
  4. Controller compatibility: previously few specific features would break with controllers. Since they no longer automatically apply their patches, ToyBox should work with controllers as long as those features aren't enabled.
  5. Less stuff that can cause different behaviour even though no relevant feature is activated (Did you know: ToyBox added an extra renderer/highlighter for every object by default. Why it did that, none of the remaining devs know (or even knew about that at all))

Reworked Browsers. Again:
- Improved search performance by performing consecutive searches on the already found subset; also removed some synchronization
- Abstracted things in such a way that it would be possible to support an alternate fuzzy search mode

Changed some features:
- Fixed Preview Dialog Results predicting the wrong dialog paths in rare situations
- PreventPsychicPhenomena now prevents all (including Unsanctioned Psyker)
- CustomizePsychicPhenomena now also accounts for phenomena triggered in a non-standard way (e.g. Unsanctioned Psyker)
- Add proper names/descriptions to each phenomena in CustomizePsychicPhenomena
- Ignore Equipment Restrictions adjusted for armour?
- Fig Ignore Ability Requirement XYZ not working if Ignore All Requirements is disabled (which made the other togles useless)
- Fix some level up ui issues that could happen if people changed the RespecFromX settings after doing respecs on a different setting.
- Allow custom levels in RespecFromX
- Fix Enemy Stat Multiplier not working for some stuff (e.g. Wounds)
- Filter stats displayed in Enemy Stat multiplier
- Make Drag to Aim Camera persist in the session
- Add new Dice Roll options; Fix some?

Removed useless/unimplemented features:
- Lots of things were leftover from the initial Wrath => RogueTrader port and/or became useless over time; the toggles/buttons basically did nothing but were still in the UI and sometimes still applied their patches.
- Non-Exhaustive list (because they became useless in RT, were not implemented or exist as base game option):
  - Common Buffs Button
  - Remove Deaths Door Button
  - Preview Dialog Alignment Toggle
  - Previously Chosen Dialog is Smaller Toggle
  - Mark Interesting NPCs toggle
  - Don't wait for keypress when loading saves toggle
  - Allow Modifier + Click To Use Items in Inventory
  - Invert X Axis (Mouse + Keyboard)
  - Vision Range
  - Enhanced Map View
  - Mark Interesting NPCs
  - Show Rarity Tags
  - Color Item Names
  - Inventory item use during combat

Rewrote Inspector:
- More options
- Less crashes
